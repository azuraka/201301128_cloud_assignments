                ============================= Mininet Topology ==========================

                To run the code :-
                    1) Install mininet
                    2) Type the following command in terminal 'sudo python topology.py'

                We are creating a linear topology in which all the switches are connected
                in series and the hosts are connected to the switches. The odd numbered
                and even numbered hosts are given a bandwidth of 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps respectively.

                Even numbered hosts can ping each other but not the odd ones.
                Same applies for the odd numbered hosts.
